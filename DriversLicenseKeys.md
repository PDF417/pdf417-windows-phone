## Keys for obtaining US Driver's license data

Standard for US Driver's Licenses defines 9 different barcode standards (AAMVA versions) with over 80 different fields encoded inside a barcode. Some fields exist on all barcode standards, other exist only on some. To standardize the API, we have structured the fields in the following sections:

1. [Determining AAMVA version](#020601)
2. [Keys existing on all barcode versions](#020602)
	- [Mandatory values](#0206021)
		- [Personal data](#02060211)
		- [License data](#02060212)
	- [Optional values](#0206022)
		- [Personal data](#02060221)
		- [License data](#02060222)
3. [Keys existing on some barcode versions](#020603)
	- [Mandatory values](#0206031)
		- [Personal data](#02060311)
		- [License data](#02060312)
	- [Optional values](#0206032)
